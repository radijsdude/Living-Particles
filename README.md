# Living-Particles
Artificial life

Made with SDL2/sdl.h (it only uses the drawpoint function to draw circles in visual.c and program.c, and window handling)

To compile this:
compile the program.c file with SDL2
Windows ( http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/windows/codeblocks/ )
Made in Kali Linux with gcc and SDL2

This still needs some tweeking and optimizing.
